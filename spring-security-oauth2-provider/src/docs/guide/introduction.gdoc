The OAuth2 plugin adds [OAuth 2.0|http://oauth.net/2/] support to a Grails application that uses Spring Security. It depends on [Spring Security Core plugin|http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-core].

Under the covers, [Spring Security OAuth version 2.0.2.RELEASE|http://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth/] is used by the plugin to provide OAuth 2.0 services. This documentation specifies a few specific steps you will have to take in order to ensure proper integration with the underlying library.

This plugin provides support for Grails domain classes necessary for providing OAuth 2.0 authorization. The standard grant types described in [RFC 6749|http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749] are supported by the plugin. Access to protected resources is controlled by a combination of Spring Security Core's methods, i.e. request maps, annotations, intercept maps and careful configuration of the Spring Security filter chains.
